The function sort() sorts a vector in increasing order.
The function order() produces the indices needed to obtain the sorted vector, e.g. a result of  2 3 1 5 4 means the sorted vector will be produced by listing the 2nd, 3rd, 1st, 5th, and then 4th item of the original vector.
The function rank() gives us the ranks of the items in the original vector.
The function max() returns the largest value, while which.max() returns the index of the largest value. The functions min() and which.min() work similarly for minimum values.

library(dslabs)
data(murders)
sort(murders$total)

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
sort(x)    # puts elements in order

index <- order(x)    # returns index that will put x in order
x[index]    # rearranging by this index puts elements in order
order(x)

murders$state[1:10]
murders$abb[1:10]

index <- order(murders$total)
murders$abb[index]    # order abbreviations by total murders

max(murders$total)    # highest number of total murders
i_max <- which.max(murders$total)    # index with highest number of murders
murders$state[i_max]    # state name with highest number of total murders

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
rank(x)    # returns ranks (smallest to largest)

# The name of the state with the maximum population is found by doing the following
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]

# how to obtain the murder rate
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000

# ordering the states by murder rate, in decreasing order
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]
