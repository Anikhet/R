The function which() gives us the entries of a logical vector that are true.
The function match() looks for entries in a vector and returns the index needed to access them.
We use the function %in% if we want to know whether or not each element of a first vector is in a second vector.
Code
x <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
which(x)    # returns indices that are TRUE

# to determine the murder rate in Massachusetts we may do the following
index <- which(murders$state == "Massachusetts")
index
murder_rate[index]

# to obtain the indices and subsequent murder rates of New York, Florida, Texas, we do:
index <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
index
murders$state[index]
murder_rate[index]

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
y <- c("a", "d", "f")
y %in% x

# to see if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states
c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state
